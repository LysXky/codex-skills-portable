## Codex adaptation and authorization boundary

Adapted from mukul975/Anthropic-Cybersecurity-Skills for Codex.

- Use this skill only for defensive work, education, controlled labs, CTFs, or systems covered by explicit authorization.
- Establish the target scope and authorization before taking intrusive, exploitative, credential-access, persistence, or destructive actions.
- Treat bundled scripts as untrusted utilities: inspect their source, dependencies, inputs, and side effects before execution.
- Prefer analysis, detection, validation, and safe simulation when live execution is not explicitly required.
- Translate Claude-specific tool names into available Codex tools. Translate Bash examples to PowerShell on Windows when appropriate.
- Verify current tool syntax and vendor documentation before relying on commands that may have changed.

# Implementing SIEM Use Case Tuning

## Overview

SIEM use case tuning reduces alert fatigue by systematically analyzing detection rules for false positive rates, adjusting thresholds based on environmental baselines, creating context-aware whitelists, and measuring detection efficacy through precision/recall metrics. This skill covers tuning workflows for Splunk correlation searches and Elastic detection rules, including statistical baselining, exclusion list management, and alert-to-incident conversion tracking.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing siem use case tuning capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Splunk Enterprise/Cloud with ES or Elastic SIEM with detection rules enabled
- Historical alert data (minimum 30 days) for baseline analysis
- Python 3.8+ with `requests` library
- SIEM admin credentials or API tokens

## Steps

1. Export current alert volumes per detection rule from SIEM
2. Calculate false positive rate per rule using analyst disposition data
3. Identify top noise-generating rules by volume and FP rate
4. Build environmental baselines for thresholds (e.g., login counts, process spawns)
5. Create whitelist entries for known-good entities (service accounts, scanners)
6. Adjust rule thresholds using statistical analysis (mean + N standard deviations)
7. Measure tuning impact via before/after precision and alert-to-incident ratio

## Expected Output

JSON report with per-rule tuning recommendations including current FP rate, suggested threshold adjustments, whitelist entries, and projected alert reduction percentages.
