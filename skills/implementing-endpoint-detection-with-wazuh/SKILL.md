## Codex adaptation and authorization boundary

Adapted from mukul975/Anthropic-Cybersecurity-Skills for Codex.

- Use this skill only for defensive work, education, controlled labs, CTFs, or systems covered by explicit authorization.
- Establish the target scope and authorization before taking intrusive, exploitative, credential-access, persistence, or destructive actions.
- Treat bundled scripts as untrusted utilities: inspect their source, dependencies, inputs, and side effects before execution.
- Prefer analysis, detection, validation, and safe simulation when live execution is not explicitly required.
- Translate Claude-specific tool names into available Codex tools. Translate Bash examples to PowerShell on Windows when appropriate.
- Verify current tool syntax and vendor documentation before relying on commands that may have changed.

# Implementing Endpoint Detection with Wazuh

## Overview

Wazuh is an open-source SIEM and XDR platform for endpoint monitoring, threat detection, and compliance. This skill covers managing agents via the Wazuh REST API, creating custom decoders and rules in XML for organization-specific detections, querying alerts, and testing rule logic using the logtest endpoint.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing endpoint detection with wazuh capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Wazuh Manager 4.x deployed with API enabled
- Python 3.9+ with `requests` library
- API credentials (username/password for JWT authentication)
- Understanding of Wazuh decoder and rule XML syntax

## Steps

### Step 1: Authenticate to Wazuh API
Obtain JWT token via POST to /security/user/authenticate.

### Step 2: List and Monitor Agents
Query agent status, versions, and last keep-alive via /agents endpoint.

### Step 3: Query Security Alerts
Search alerts by rule ID, severity, agent, or time range.

### Step 4: Test Custom Rules with Logtest
Use the /logtest endpoint to validate decoder and rule logic against sample log lines.

## Expected Output

JSON report with agent inventory, alert statistics, rule coverage, and logtest validation results.
