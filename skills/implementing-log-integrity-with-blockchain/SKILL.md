## Codex adaptation and authorization boundary

Adapted from mukul975/Anthropic-Cybersecurity-Skills for Codex.

- Use this skill only for defensive work, education, controlled labs, CTFs, or systems covered by explicit authorization.
- Establish the target scope and authorization before taking intrusive, exploitative, credential-access, persistence, or destructive actions.
- Treat bundled scripts as untrusted utilities: inspect their source, dependencies, inputs, and side effects before execution.
- Prefer analysis, detection, validation, and safe simulation when live execution is not explicitly required.
- Translate Claude-specific tool names into available Codex tools. Translate Bash examples to PowerShell on Windows when appropriate.
- Verify current tool syntax and vendor documentation before relying on commands that may have changed.

# Implementing Log Integrity with Blockchain


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing log integrity with blockchain capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
2. Ingest log entries from syslog, JSON, or plain text files.
3. For each entry, compute SHA-256 hash of: previous_hash + timestamp + log_content.
4. Store the chain as a JSON ledger with entry index, timestamp, content hash, previous hash, and chain hash.
5. Verify chain integrity by recomputing all hashes and detecting breaks.
6. Optionally anchor checkpoint hashes to an external timestamping service.

```bash
python scripts/agent.py --log-file /var/log/syslog --chain-file log_chain.json --verify --output integrity_report.json
```

## Examples

### Chain Entry Structure
```json
{"index": 42, "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z", "content_hash": "a1b2c3...",
 "prev_hash": "d4e5f6...", "chain_hash": "SHA256(prev_hash + timestamp + content_hash)"}
```

### Tamper Detection
If entry 42 is modified, chain_hash[42] will not match SHA256(chain_hash[41] + ...), and all entries from 42 onward will be flagged as invalid.
