## Codex adaptation and authorization boundary

Adapted from mukul975/Anthropic-Cybersecurity-Skills for Codex.

- Use this skill only for defensive work, education, controlled labs, CTFs, or systems covered by explicit authorization.
- Establish the target scope and authorization before taking intrusive, exploitative, credential-access, persistence, or destructive actions.
- Treat bundled scripts as untrusted utilities: inspect their source, dependencies, inputs, and side effects before execution.
- Prefer analysis, detection, validation, and safe simulation when live execution is not explicitly required.
- Translate Claude-specific tool names into available Codex tools. Translate Bash examples to PowerShell on Windows when appropriate.
- Verify current tool syntax and vendor documentation before relying on commands that may have changed.

# Analyzing Web Server Logs for Intrusion


## When to Use

- When investigating security incidents that require analyzing web server logs for intrusion
- When building detection rules or threat hunting queries for this domain
- When SOC analysts need structured procedures for this analysis type
- When validating security monitoring coverage for related attack techniques

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with security operations concepts and tools
- Access to a test or lab environment for safe execution
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies installed
- Appropriate authorization for any testing activities

## Instructions

1. Install dependencies: `pip install geoip2 user-agents`
2. Collect web server access logs in Combined Log Format (Apache) or Nginx default format.
3. Parse each log entry extracting: IP, timestamp, method, URI, status code, response size, user-agent, referer.
4. Apply detection rules:
   - SQL injection: `UNION SELECT`, `OR 1=1`, `' OR '`, hex encoding patterns
   - LFI/Path traversal: `../`, `/etc/passwd`, `/proc/self`, `php://filter`
   - XSS: `<script>`, `javascript:`, `onerror=`, `onload=`
   - Scanner signatures: nikto, sqlmap, dirbuster, gobuster, wfuzz user-agents
   - Brute force: >50 POST requests to login endpoints from same IP in 5 minutes
5. Enrich with GeoIP data and generate a prioritized findings report.

```bash
python scripts/agent.py --log-file /var/log/nginx/access.log --geoip-db GeoLite2-City.mmdb --output web_intrusion_report.json
```

## Examples

### Detect SQLi in URI
```
192.168.1.100 - - [15/Jan/2024:10:30:45 +0000] "GET /products?id=1' UNION SELECT username,password FROM users-- HTTP/1.1" 200 4532
```

### Scanner User-Agent Detection
```
Nikto/2.1.6, sqlmap/1.7, DirBuster-1.0-RC1, gobuster/3.1.0
```
